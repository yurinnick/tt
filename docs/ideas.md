Great ideas and todo list
=========================

* Store managers' changes as patches to original JSON files (if possible)
* Allow end-user to switch between orginal version of timetable and manager's one. Some cases when managers are dicks. It should be performed on-the-fly, I think, but store only one version of the timetable to avoid mess


* Handling and editing timetables on mobile devices with drag-n-drop feature. Cells of the table can be dragged and swap with the cell, where the first one goes.
